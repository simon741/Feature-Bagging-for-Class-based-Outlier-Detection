# Feature-Bagging-for-Class-based-Outlier-Detection

In this university group project of 2, we tried to combine 2 different class outlier detection methods (CODB, RF-OEX) with 2 different bagging methods (cum-sum, breadth-first). On the end, we compared the results. We did the implementation using RapidMiner, Weka and R.  Based on the article http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.80.1204
